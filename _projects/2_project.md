I have worked extensively on aluminium product development, encompassing a range of casting techniques such as High-Pressure Die Casting (HPDC), Gravity Die Casting (GDC), Low-Pressure Die Casting (LPDC), Gas Induced Semi-Solid (GISS), High Integrity High-Pressure Die Casting (HI_HPDC), and RheoCastings, as well as new grain refiner research and aluminium recycling. My experience also includes forging processes for alloys in the 2XXX, 6XXX, and 7XXX series.

The products I have developed, not limited to, include cylinder blocks, cylinder heads, gearbox housings, compressor impeller housings, ladder frames, oil pan castings, knuckles, alloy wheels, various pressure-tight aluminium alloy castings, proprietary high-performance alloys, and structural castings of aluminium alloys.
