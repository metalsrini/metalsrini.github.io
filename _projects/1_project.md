I have worked extensively on aluminium product development, encompassing a range of casting techniques such as High-Pressure Die Casting (HPDC), Gravity Die Casting (GDC), Low-Pressure Die Casting (LPDC), Gas Induced Semi-Solid (GISS), High Integrity High-Pressure Die Casting (HI_HPDC), and RheoCastings, as well as new grain refiner research and aluminium recycling. My experience also includes forging processes for alloys in the 2XXX, 6XXX, and 7XXX series.

The products I have developed, not limited to, include cylinder blocks, cylinder heads, gearbox housings, compressor impeller housings, ladder frames, oil pan castings, knuckles, alloy wheels, various pressure-tight aluminium alloy castings, proprietary high-performance alloys, and structural castings of aluminium alloys.

    Project 1: High Quality Al Ingot Development for Cylinder Head Application  
    title: Al Recycling 
    description: Establishing critical quality parameters to meet stringent requirements and achieve best-in-class standards
    Challenges Faced : Controlling hydrogen gas and inclusion levels to ensure superior quality.
    ---

This development marks a significant milestone as it was a localization project in India, where we successfully tackled cost challenges while maintaining superior quality.

    Project 2: New Grain Refiner Research for Al Gravity Die Castings  
    title: Al GDC 
    description: Research on Nb Based refiners and prototype developement for High Strength Alloy Development 
    Challenges Faced : Developemnt of Nb based master alloy  
    ---

I have developed and prototyped castings using Nb-based grain refiners to refine the grain size of aluminium GDC castings. This innovation is instrumental in optimizing heat treatment parameters, achieving strength in the as-cast stage, and thereby reducing overall costs.
